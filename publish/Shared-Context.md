# Shared-Context

In language exchange, look for shared context to multiply the amount of understanding in a conversation. For example, when my Chinese language ability was quite low my tutor pulled up a picture of Lord of the Rings characters and we were able to have quite a lively discussion since we both knew these people quite well.
