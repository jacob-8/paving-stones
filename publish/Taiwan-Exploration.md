## Local options

### Lotus Pond & The Dragon and Tiger Pagodas & Kaohsiung Confucius Temple

### Fongyi Academy
Former Qing Dynasty academy constructed in 1814 is now used to show the Confucian way of life. "To the east of the city center, the Fongyi Academy is a whimsical recreation of a traditional Chinese academy, complete with colorful life-sized statue representations of various characters from the era. There’s a space where you can dress up in Qing dynasty garb, and for those looking for a more serious take on history, next door to the Fongyi Academy is the Fongshan Chenghuang Temple, a more traditional Taoist Temple."

## Scooters
- good info: https://taiwan-scene.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-getting-a-scooter-license-in-taiwan/
- can get license after ARC
- can't drive on [national highways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_system_in_Taiwan#/map/0) but that's hardly an issue are those are not pretty routes anyways
