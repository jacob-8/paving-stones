# Daily Regimen

Here is my current daily menu of language study activities. Do an activity for a focused 15 minutes at a time then take a break.

- 1 session of chorusing or a pronunciation course exercise (tone pairs/etc) 
   - I'm currently using textbook audio but would like to locate level appropriate materials from a male speaker. My current Mandarin Companion audio is recorded by a female speaker.
- Enough (maybe 3) extensive reading sessions to make it through a chapter of a graded reader or find 10 new words
- 2-6 Scriptorium sessions
- 1 session of shadowing through material previously chorused, read, or scripted
- 1-2 flashcard review sessions (includes analyzing components of newly added characters)
- Podcast lesson from ChinesePod or ChineseClass101
- *If extra time* sing songs or watch clips w/ caption help for unknown words

Between study bursts, take a drink of water, walk/jump/push-up if sitting or sit if already walking.
