# Paths In Progress

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my attempt to put down paving stones of information that clearly mark out the learning paths I've taken in hopes that others can benefit from them as well as help me improve them. Read [[about]] how I publish them if you're interested.

1. [[Language-Learning]]
2. [[Programming]]
3. i18n (Internationalization)

This is where the two paths above converge in a manner that unlocks the ability to make information useful to a larger audience.
