# Paths In Progress

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my attempt to put down paving stones of information that clearly mark out the learning paths I've taken in hopes that others can benefit from them as well as help me improve them. Read [[about]] how I publish them if you're interested.

## Programming

Programming is the process of solving a tedious problem by taking advantage of the calculating machines in our pockets. For example, if I can write software that can parse through all the words in a book, create a list of them including frequency counts, then compare that to a list of words in a language I know so far in a language I'm learning, then I can very easily answer some important questions about said desired reading material:
- What percentage of the words do I know?
  - If ~98% then it's a good candidate for [[Extensive Reading]].
- Which of the words that I don't know are the most common?
  - The follow-up question being then, how many of them do I need to learn to get to be able to understand X percentage of the characters in this reading.
