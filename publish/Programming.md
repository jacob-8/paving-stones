# Programming

Programming is the process of solving a tedious problem by taking advantage of the calculating machines in our pockets. For example, if I can write software that can parse through all the words in a book, create a list of them including frequency counts, then compare that to a list of words in a language I know so far in a language I'm learning, then I can very easily answer some important questions about said desired reading material:
- What percentage of the words do I know?
  - If ~98% then it's a good candidate for [[extensive-reading]].
  
- Which of the words that I don't know are the most common?
  - The follow-up question being then, how many of them do I need to learn to get to be able to understand X percentage of the characters in this reading?

Since programming is an invaluable help to accomplishing tasks, I'm trying to improve specifically in a few ways:
- better documentation to allow for better collaboration with others as well as to more easily tackle large projects without forgetting important findings and information
- better advertisment of tool functions so that others can use them as well which will both help find bugs and push the tools to become even more useful to me and them alike.

## Tools of Interest to Review
A few tools have come across my desk that look potentially useful but I haven't had time to investigate:
- [Replay](https://replay.io/)
- [Github Code Search Beta](https://cs.github.com/)
