# About

I use [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/) to write these notes in markdown files. They are automatically published to Vercel using https://github.com/hikerpig/foam-template-gatsby-kb. For a simpler config of this template you can look at https://github.com/hikerpig/gatsby-project-kb/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-kb.

I chose this template because of the useful tabel of contents as well as knowledge graph (on desktop). Other options I considered were https://github.com/mathieudutour/foam-gatsby-template and https://github.com/theowenyoung/foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki
