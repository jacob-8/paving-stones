# About

I use [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/) in **VS Code** to write these notes in markdown files. They are automatically published to Vercel using [foam-template-gatsby-kb](https://github.com/hikerpig/foam-template-gatsby-kb)

I chose this template because of the useful table of contents as well as the knowledge graph (desktop-only). Other options I considered were https://github.com/mathieudutour/foam-gatsby-template and https://github.com/theowenyoung/foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki

I added `gatsby-remark-embed-video` and `gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe` to allow for easy embed of youtube videos by simply adding this to my notes:
```
`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oudgdh6tl00`
```
